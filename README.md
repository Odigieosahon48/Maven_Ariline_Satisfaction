# Maven_Ariline_Satisfaction
This project seeks to explore data gotten from maven analytics on Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as ther evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.
Along the course of the project, the data was cleaned, before exploration took place, and some insights gotten include:
Which percentage of airline passengers are satisfied? Does it vary by customer type? What about type of travel?
What is the customer profile for a repeating airline passenger?
Does flight distance affect customer preferences or flight patterns?
